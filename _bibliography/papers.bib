  abstract = "{In the last couple of years, augmented reality (AR) has become one of the most anticipated emerging technologies. The technology is becoming more intimate with people's everyday lives, and user experiences are getting more vivid year by year. However, most of the current AR experiences rely on interacting with virtual content augmented on the real world, becoming less impressive and exciting than they were in the first place. In this article, we explore a new perspective on enriching AR experiences for their emerging mature state. We first investigate interaction schemes in AR environments in detail and highlight potential features in the context of interacting with the real world. We also provide a brief discussion on technical challenges and issues to realize interacting with the real world in online AR scenarios. We believe that this article will initiate new research interests and directions for the next level of AR experiences.}",
